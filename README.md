# Clustering-Association
I request to add on to this 
There are many algorithms out there for clustering and association. 
          I am new to the data science field this based on what I have explored till now ( Baby steps ) . 
The problem discussed here is standard one. Anyone will come across this problem and is used as examples for teaching basics of data science problems.  I request to guys to add to this this.
The firm is “techzion”, an online ecommerce organization. The firm has collected around 10000 orders details over period of time. Many of the interesting and important attributes of customer’s online transactions are captured in detailed manner.  
The firm is interested to harvest the captured transaction data to improvise their existing processes by adapting to the data driven decision making. Their two major objectives are to:
•	Understand the existing customer base better manner
•	Build up a recommender system
Clustering : 


The first task would be do unsupervised learning. We do the clustering and try to get insights form the clusters .
I am also attaching the solution I could do ….
I found it in the link below .

Task 2 Association : 
Next we Write a python program that prepares a dataset consisting only of:
•	Order/transaction id
•	Items purchased in that order
 
As an outcome of previous step we can use apriori algorithm and then try to find
•	frequent itemsets generated along with their support values
•	top 10 rules sorted by confidence 
•	top 10 rules sorted by lift
